                        <p>For the last 50 years, I have been always mingled with people mostly from rural areas, who are poor and uneducated. Even though they are uneducated, most of them have dreams about the education of their children. There were very few technical institutions before 1980 in this central part of Karnataka and it was very difficult for these villagers to go to faraway places for education. My vision was to provide a quality technical education to these needy people so that students from remote villages can become world class engineers and help in building our great nation. Keeping this in view, Bapuji Institute of Engineering and Technology (BIET) was established in 1979 under the banner of Bapuji Educational Association. Care was also taken to establish rare engineering disciplines like Textile Technology, Bio-Technology, Chemical Engineering, Instrumentation Technology, etc., so that the possible research can be undertaken in these areas to suit the local needs. Over the years, with the support of large number of parents and the hard working faculty, the institute has grown to be one of best in this part of Karnataka with an area of around 65 acres housing various buildings and all the necessary infrastructure creating a conducive atmosphere for world class education. At present the institute offers most of the important branches of engineering at undergraduate and post graduate levels. Many research centres have also been established to cater to the needs of present day situation.</p>
                        <p><b>“Culture and behaviour are more important than felicitation and money”.</b> These lines are quoted by Sri Basavanna who believed in educating everyone and reform the society. We strongly believe in these words and try hard to impart a good culture and behaviour along with providing a quality education. My dear aspirants of technical education, I whole heartedly welcome you all to this great BIET family for building your bright future.</p>
