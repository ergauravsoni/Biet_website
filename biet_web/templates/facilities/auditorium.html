						Most of the students in the rural areas are devoid of good facilities for arranging and taking part in different cultural events, which are must to build overall personality of the young minds. Keeping this in view, S. S. Mallikarjun Cultural centre has been established in the campus of BIET. The auditorium has been built in Contemporary Architectural style of the 21st century adopting mixture of several different styles, from postmodernism and high-tech architecture to highly conceptual and expressive forms and designs, resembling sculpture on an enormous scale. Architectural designs are supplied and work supervised by M/s Shankar Associates, Coimbatore. Total built-up area is around 5500 square meters and the total expense made for completion of the work is around 28 crores. The auditorium has a seating capacity of 700 provided with two VIP balconies. Wide stage with remote controlled screens and a made to order AHA-ELF 72D Digital Podium provides complete options and control to the presenter/performer. A high-tech projecting system is supplied by Christie, Canada. Audio system is supplied by US BOSCH which provides all possible types of graphic equalizers for different tunes and voices in vocal pedagogy in the audible range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Acoustics are designed and supplied by HARA Design, Germany.  A made to order lighting system provides complete illumination arrangement as per the requirement of the performance giving an eye cooling effect. Modern green rooms with all facilities are provided separately for boys and girls. One rest room is provided to meet any emergency condition. A well-equipped cafeteria is provided for food supply during the performances. Sufficient parking place with green landscaping provides an eye catching effect. Many national leaders including Mr. Rahul Gandhi and many known artists have visited the auditorium and appreciated the facilities.
